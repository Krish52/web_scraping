Web Scraping App for 4 eCommerce Websites
This is my first Web scraping app for the following 4 e-commerce websites:
  ebay
  Flipkart
  Best Buy and
  newegg

 When you paste the url from either of the above mentioned websites, the product information (Name, Price, Discount, etc.,) will be saved
 into and '.CSV' file.

 Will be updating the app with some more revisions soon.

Please help me in the development of the App by pointing out the mistakes or letting me know if any method can be done simpler.
This is app is just for me to learn more about Python and Kivy
